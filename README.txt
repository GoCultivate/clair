Collections and Internal Records Management

Demo site is here: http://clair.on95.com

CLAIR is an open-source Collections And Internal Records management
system built as a Drupal distribution. It gives museums and institutions
the ability to manage online collections and can be used as an
"out-of-the-box" Collections Management System. It is fully customizable
and designed to provide a base system that can be customized and scaled
to meet most (if not all) business requirements.

CLAIR uses the concept of Collections and Objects. Collections are
groupings of objects; a collection may be an exhibition with related
events, digital assets, and articles. Or a collection may be an artist
with related blog posts, images, videos, and exhibitions. It's very
flexible and integrates with views. CLAIR includes a number of default
objects (events, blogs, digital assets, more) or you can add your own.
Roles, permissions, and workflows can be configured for collections and
objects as well.

CLAIR uses a number of contributed modules, custom modules, and features
for the following feature set:

- Drag-and-drop interface based on Panels
- Out-of-the-box responsive theme using Bartik
- Organic Groups for collections management
- Features for objects
- Events and Calendaring
- Blogs (aka articles)
- Images, Slideshows, and (shortly!) Galleries
- Workflows
- More

Note: the 7.x-2.x branch is being developed as an installation profile and 
is under active development. The 7.x-1.x branch is not currently supported.
